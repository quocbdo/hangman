Project 1: Client-side Game README

i. Skater Hangman
The age old game of hangman is given a skateboarding themed spin! The player assumes the role of the skater and must evade the evil security guard by correctly guessing the randomly generated secret skate-themed word using the alphbet keys below. The included categories are skate tricks, pro skateboarders, and famous skate spots. You get 9 tries, so make them count or else you'll be busted by security! Guess the secret word correctly within 9 tries and you will successfully escape from security! Click the Reset Game button at the bottom to start a fresh game at any time.
